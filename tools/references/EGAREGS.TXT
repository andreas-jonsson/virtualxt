3C0h:  Attribute Controller: Address register
bit 0-4  Address of data register to write to port 3C0h.
      5  If set screen output is enabled and the palette can not be modified,
         if clear screen output is disabled and the palette can be modified.


Port 3C0h is special in that it is both address and data-write register.
An internal flip-flop remembers whether it is currently acting as address or
data register. Accesses to the attribute controller must be separated by at
least 250ns. Reading port 3dAh will reset the flip-flop to address mode.

3CEh index  3  (W):  Graphics: Data Rotate
bit 0-2  Number of positions to rotate data right before it is written to
         display memory. Only active in Write Mode 0.
    3-4  In Write Mode 2 this field controls the relation between the data
         written from the CPU, the data latched from the previous read and the
         data written to display memory:
           0: CPU Data is written unmodified
           1: CPU data is ANDed with the latched data
           2: CPU data is ORed  with the latch data.
           3: CPU data is XORed with the latched data.

3CEh index  4  (W):  Graphics: Read Map Select Register
bit 0-1  Number of the plane Read Mode 0 will read from.

3CEh index  5  (W):  Graphics: Mode Register
bit 0-1  Write Mode: Controls how data from the CPU is transformed before
         being written to display memory:
           0: Mode 0 works as a Read-Modify-Write operation.
              First a read access loads the data latches of the EGA with the
              value in video memory at the addressed location. Then a write
              access will provide the destination address and the CPU data
              byte. The data written is modified by the function code in the
              Data Rotate register (3CEh index 3) as a function of the CPU
              data and the latches, then data is rotated as specified by the
              same register.
           1: Mode 1 is used for video to video transfers.
              A read access will load the data latches with the contents of
              the addressed byte of video memory. A write access will write
              the contents of the latches to the addressed byte. Thus a single
              MOVSB instruction can copy all pixels in the source address byte
              to the destination address.
           2: Mode 2 writes a color to all pixels in the addressed byte of
              video memory. Bit 0 of the CPU data is written to plane 0 et
              cetera. Individual bits can be enabled or disabled through the
              Bit Mask register (3CEh index 8).
      2  Forces all outputs to a high impedance state if set.
      3  Read Mode
           0: Data is read from one of 4 bit planes depending on the Read Map
              Select Register (3CEh index 4).
           1: Data returned is a comparison between the 8 pixels occupying the
              read byte and the color in the Color Compare Register (3CEh
              index 2). A bit is set if the color of the corresponding pixel
              matches the register.
      4  Enables Odd/Even mode if set (See 3C4h index 4 bit 2).
      5  Enables CGA style 4 color pixels using even/odd bit pairs if set.

           1: use A000h-AFFFh   EGA Graphics modes
           2: use B000h-B7FFh   Monochrome modes
